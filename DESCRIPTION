Title: Analysing uncertainty in biodiversity occurrence data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Marco D'Antraccoli, Gianni Bedini, Lorenzo Peruzzi

Description: A framework able to explicitly consider the spatial and temporal uncertainties intrinsic in floristic occurrence records and aimed to return two main outputs:
    (i) a ‘Map of Floristic Ignorance’ (MFI), a map representing the spatial distribution of the lack in floristic knowledge across cells in a study site.
    (ii) a ‘Virtual Floristic List’ (VFL) of taxa potentially occurring within a study site, in which a probability of occurrence is computed for every taxon.
